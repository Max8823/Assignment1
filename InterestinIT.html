        <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
      <p> My Interest in IT started when I was quite young, my Dad was an IT consultant and worked from home so I was always around computers and servers although most of my knowledge was surface level until I joined the army in 2012.
        During my time in the military I became more aware of IT and the scale of what the term “IT” truly encompasses. 
        During my last year I felt like every second week there was something new; from different types of radios, gps, commanders tablets, tracking and positioning gadgets, bore-sight tools
         where becoming more common place, everything was starting to become more “digital”. </p>

        <p>
        After I left the Army I decided that I would start studying IT naturally I was drawn heavily towards Information security and started taking some of the online courses,
        such as Comtia Network and linux+ offered at sites such as CYBRARY.IT,EdX and UDEMY while taking part in these courses I started to become more interested in programming,
         and started taking some courses in learning how to code using CODEACADEMY.

        <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT after debating between universities around a year for two Main Reasons: <br><br>
        1.	Online option: <br>
        RMIT allows students to complete the degree online and from home, this is held a lot of weight as 
        it grants me with a higher degree of flexibility in regards to work, gym and life in general.<br><br>
         </p>
      <p>2.	Programming scope:<br>
        My main focus or goal while studying at RMIT is to gain a broader understanding of programming, 
        refine my current skill set and gain feedback on what I can already produce. In comparison to a lot of
         other Universities curriculum RMIT has a lot more programming on offer in particular linux and c++ where good selling points.
         <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
         <p>During my time here at RMIT I am hoping to expand my skill set and to become a more proficient programmer
            in particular I hope to be able to produce more polished looking projects as my GUI and overall graphical design and implementation is severely lacking.</p>
