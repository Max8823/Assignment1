        <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
        <h3>Software Engineer / Developer Programmer</h3>

        <h4><a href="https://kesys.com.au/"> Kesys Technologies pty ltd</a></h4>
        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51767785?type=standard#searchRequestToken=6618f78e-e634-4f90-a202-9b3eeebb8ad4">Job advertisment</a>

      <p> Kesys technologies is a is a software solutions-based company headquartered in Sydney. 
        With over 12 years’ experience they assist companies in developing software, auditing, and cyber security.</p>
     <h2> Job Description</h2>
     <p>The job I have chosen is: Software engineer / developer programmer, requiring the candidate to design and modify new and existing software to maximise performance
        and efficiency. The candidate must also train new users to use new equipment, perform several analysis tasks such as
         the analysis of information to recommend the purchase or creation of certain software or hardware.</p>
         <h2> What makes this job attractive?</h2>
         <p>This job is attractive to me as it appears to be quite broad in scope giving plenty of variety to the job, Kesys technologies develop 
           Artificial Intelligence and cyber security-based solutions both of which are fields that I am very interested in so there would likely be exposure and work conducted
            in these fields. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="body2">
      <h2>Skills and qualifications required for the position</h2>
    <p> Kesys technologies are requesting the candidate be a citizen or permanent resident of Australia, have a Masters in IT with at least 2 years’ experience in a leading role,
       and a 10-year previous experience in software development. The ability to communicate well, work in a team and independently and to be willing to relocate within Australia 
       or overseas.
        </p>
    
       <h2>What skills and qualifications do you currently have?</h2>
       <p>My current experience is heavily lacking, as I have never worked in the IT industry as a free-lancer or otherwise. I have no formal qualifications or certificates, 
         although I have completed various online programming courses, as well as having completed the Comptia A+, Network+, and Security + courses but have not taken the formal 
         assessments to acquire the certification.</p>
         
         <h2>How do you plan on gaining the experience and qualification?</h2>
         <p>In order to be qualified for this role I would first need to finish my bachelors here at RMIT, upon completion I could then do an 
           Honours in software engineering likely at a different University as I am unsure if RMIT has this option, although I am aware that QUT does. <br><br>

          Once I have finished my Honours (if applicable) I would then either attempt to enter the workforce as a junior software engineer
           in order to gain some hands on and real-life experience that I will need to acquire before applying for the job, or I will continue my studies and 
           proceed to commence my master’s the year after. Considering the job an Honours and masters in: Software development, cyber security, or 
           artificial intelligence would likely be the best course of action. This pathway so far is likely to take at least 6 years of uninterrupted
            full-time study provided that all units are passed and completed on time.
          
          <br><br>During my time studying I could try and get a part time job, or an internship working in a junior role to help with the gaining of required years’ experience.
