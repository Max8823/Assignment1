        <h2>Project idea</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p> The project I have decided upon is both an image classifier and reverse image searcher application. The application can be implemented in a number of forms:
         As an application ( mobile), program ( PC), website, or all 3. Depending upon the relevant experiences of other members of the group.
        The project will function by a user uploading or providing an image which the program will analyze and then conduct a reverse image search whilst 
        analyzing the results to provide the most relevant possible matches. 
         </p>
         <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>the motivation behind this project is to provide the end user with the ability to identify images that contain something the user is unsure about 
          (for example, a user may have certain pests infecting their garden, and want to know what they are so they can get rid of them, or another user may want to know the model
           of somebodies watch or shoes so they may purchase them.The application could provide links to sites or shops that sell the products or to 
           Wikipedia pages for non- purchasable goods (pets, plants, geological entities)  
          
       
         </p>
       </div>

    <div class="body2">
        <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The application itself should contain several features such as a cropping tool, advanced settings, and tags.
         The cropping tool can be used to clear out any background color or possible interference by the user, the background will be automatically replaced by a white background
          as this is the default online retailers use when displaying products.<br>
         </p>
            <p> The advanced settings should allow for a tint and bloom effect as the image classifier will process images pixel by pixel and note the color of the pixels
               the tint and bloom effects could be designed to either remove the shadow / bloom or to allow for a certain margin of error when cross analyzing images.
               Other options include exact color whereby the program would only show results (if any) applicable results held the same color values in the same locations as
                the user image. And to choose what image search engines are to be used whilst searching. The tags are simply for the user to input what the image or to “name” the 
                image. (eg, shoes, lighter, light, ect) </p>

    
         <p>The application will function as following, when the user uploads an image, they are presented with the option to edit the image and change some settings.
            Once the user has made their desired changes to the image and have selected and modified the settings to be used, the program will then ask the user,
             if they wish to continue, once the user continues the image classifier will analyze the image. Taking every pixel and storing their color value as an array
              in a linear fashion. After this the program will then perform a reverse image search and analyze the results starting with the first, once an appropriate match/s
               have been found, the program will display the results.</p>
               
      
               <h2>Tools and Technologies required</h2>
              
        <p>The Tools and technologies required are not numerous, a physical device to run the program on, internet connection (preferably high-speed internet)
           are the only tools and technologies needed. If the program is to be developed using an existing image analyzer then one can be selected from the existing 140 on github,
            they can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/topics/image-classifier"> Image classifiers</a>  </p>

            <h2>Skills required</h2>
            <p>The skills required for developing such a program are quite advanced, a solid understanding of proofs by induction, and applied mathematics as a whole are required.
               Additionally, understanding of web-design would be highly recommended, especially if the project is to be implemented in the form of a website. 
               Knowledge of either Java or Python would be highly recommended as both are highly compatible with other languages which will need to be utilized for the program 
               to function.</p>

               <h2>Outcome</h2>
               <p>If the project is successful, the end result can be measured and determined by the programs ability to accurately classify and identify relevant images.
                  The program can be altered to have machine learning capabilities where eventually a reverse image search may not be required if enough images have been correctly
                   identified by the program, increasing efficiency and accuracy further.</p>
