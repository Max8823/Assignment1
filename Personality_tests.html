      <h2>Personality Tests</h2>
      <h2>Test 1 - Myers-Briggs</h2>

      <h4><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality"> Myers-Briggs Test</a></h4>
      <h4>Turbulent logician</h4>
      <img src="./Img/Img4.png" alt="">

    <p> Logicians love patterns and spotting discrepancies, making them great analysts and abstract thinkers, Logicians ideas may seem counter-intuitive at times
      but they will always prove remarkable innovations. Often logicians can become so caught up in their own logic that they forget to consider the emotional
      side of things, this lack of sympathy is often attributed to them being insensitive.
    </p>

   <h2> Test 2 - Big 5 personality traits</h2>
   <h4><a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2,2.5,2.3,3.5,4.4#_V"> Big 5 personality test</a></h4>

   <p>Factor I was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.
    Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins. <br><br>
    Factor II is labeled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other names, such as Neruoticism or Negative Emotionality
     (in these two cases interpretations are inverted, as Neruoticism and Negative Emotionality can be though of as the opposite of Emotional Stability).<br><br>
    
    Factor III is labeled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. Low scorers are critical and aggressive.<br><br>
    Factor IV is labeled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.<br><br>
    Factor V is labeled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience. People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional.
    </p>
       <h2> Test 3 - Learning styles test</h2>
       <h4><a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/study-skills-articles/visual-learner.asp"> Visual Learner</a></h4>
       <img src="./Img/Img6.gif" alt="">

       <p> Visual learners learn best when information is presented in written form rather than if information is presented in other ways such as pictures or diagrams.
         Visual learners should study in a place free of visual distractions, watch videos about the tops they are studying and should replace words with symbols when
        possible whilst studying to assist in their efforts. </p>

    <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
  <p> The results of the tests are in my opinion quite accurate with few exceptions; <br><br>

    The results from test 2 showed high levels of imagination however, I have difficulty in simply writing stories or creating characters and plot lines, 
    but can create and come up with programs and ideas for websites much easier. Personally I believe this is due to a lack of information and combined with
     other personality traits frustrates me easily which only exacerbates the problem of lack of work which in turn frustrates me more.<br>
    
    In the third test the result stated I was a “visual learner” however I consider myself to be a practical learner and will only truly learn
     a new skill or how to do something after I continuously go through the motions and complete the task myself. Often,
      I can read instructions many times and still be incapable until I have at least attempted the task and have worked it out for myself.<br><br>
    
    I do however agree with most of the results from the other tests, I am quite an introverted person and are unlikely to instigate conversation especially with 
    people I have never met before. I acknowledge I am also quite an aggressive person however due to the fact I am introverted I am unlikely to instigate conflict unless provoked.<br>

    
    I do agree with the logician trait from the 16 personalities test and enjoy studying new and emerging technologies and often find myself over-working projects and ideas
     as there always appears to be something missing, something that can be improved or that maybe too much work has been put in and I have missed the point of an assignment
      or project entirely while too focussed on what I was doing, as such I can often “miss the point”. <br>
      I also agree with the levels of “thinking, conscientiousness and prospecting” from the 16 personalities and big 5 personality tests it is quite common for me to try and
       analyse the best point for me to enter conversation and to reflect upon myself and how I am acting within society and privately so I can work on my flaws in particular
        my aggressiveness.
    
      </p>
  
     <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
     <p>Personally, I believe that these results are not typically ideal for working in group settings, my overthinking and introverted personality
        make me less likely to present my ideas to the group and when I do often, I present them with an Illiad of an explanation and can become easily frustrated
         when people are taking too long to decide on what we should be doing. Often, I will simply wait until an idea is suggested and agree with whichever idea
          would need my vote to gain a majority regardless of whether I like or agree with what is being presented.</p>
       
       <h2>How should you take this into consideration when forming a team?</h2>
       <p>I should try to take into consideration that everybody has different skills, and not everybody has experience some will be more experienced
          which can be a good opportunity to learn from them, however I should be patient with those who are new to IT.
           I should also try and be more vocal and involved with group discussions when ideas are being thrown around If I believe I can contribute in a valuable way
            I should voice my opinion instead of being complacent.  <br><br>
